Radiant Earth Foundation is a nonprofit technology company working to expand access to geospatial data and machine learning models that can be used to address the impacts of climate change and support conservation efforts.

Our primary initiatives:

## Radiant MLHub
Radiant MLHub is the worldâ€™s first cloud-based open library dedicated to Earth observation training data for use with machine learning algorithms. Access open datasets and machine learning models from NASA, Planet, University of Maryland and others at https://mlhub.earth

## STAC
The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC) metadata specification is a common language to describe geospatial information to make it more accessible and interoperable. Learn more about STAC at https://stacspec.org/

## Machine Learning Challenges
We help organize challenges to create capacity building opportunities and accelerate development of machine learning models to interpret Earth observation data.
